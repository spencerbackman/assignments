    <h1>Hi!</h1> 
    <span>Mugshot Photobooth is there for any event you are planning. We have gone to charity events, 
        parties, weddings, family reunions, and anything else that attracts a crowd of people. We 
        are here to help your guests have a good time at your event. On top of that we like to give 
        them a strip of pictures for them to take home, not like the usual party favor.. Something 
        that will actually make them remember your special day! <br> Feel free to reach out at any 
        time and we will reply within a few days. Thanks for visiting!</span>

    <h2>Packages & Pricing</h2>
    <p>I offer a basic package, and then from there you can add anything you want in the "Extras" section.
        If I don't already have something as an add-on feel free to contact me! I'd be more than willing to
        try new things. Also, if my prices don't fit within your budget feel free to reach out. I want to 
        be at your event as bad as you want me there so we can figure something out. :)</p>
