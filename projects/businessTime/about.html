<h1>About</h1>
    <span>Hey there! 
            My name is Talia and I am the owner of Mugshot Photobooth.  I designed,
            built, and run Mugshot Phobooth primarily by myself but with the help of
            my husband and brother. I recently got married in June of 2017 and what 
            inspired me to create my photobooth was that I couldn't find a reasonably 
            priced photobooth in the Draper area that was actually cute! So off I went 
            on my adventure of starting a business and helping other brides and event 
            planners find what I was looking for myself.  Because I have done lots of 
            research on different Photobooths in Utah I know how hard it is to find 
            someone who will help you get exactly what you're looking for. That is why 
            I am completely open to your ideas and making your event exactly how you picture it! 
            Don't hesitate to contact me or ask any questions. 
            I look forward to working with you :) </span>
