    <header>Mans best friend.</h3>
    </div>
    <article> <span style="font-weight: bold"> Mans best friend...</span>  Wonder what I'm talking about? Dogs of course! I own a bernese mountain dog poodle mix. He is 15 months old and weights about 80 pounds.
        He has taught me a lot. His life is all about trying to get <span style="font-weight: bold"> attention, love, and treats.</span> As a dog all you have is your owner. My dog will live anywhere from 10-15 years. 
        That's all hes got and he wants to spend every minute of his life with me by his side. My dogs favorite part of everyday is when I get home! I love dogs!
